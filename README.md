# Customer-Segmenation

This project was taken upon as a Capstone Project for my internship at TheMathCompany. As a group of 4 we were tasked with understanding and contextualising the problem statement, perform EDA, finalise variables after VIF, test different models like regression, random forest, SVM, etc to determine key results. 

In this project the following were accomplished - 

1. The problem statement definition can be found in - Customer_Segmentation_VOX.pdf document 

2. Generated Data dictionary to thoroughly understand the dataset - Data Dictionary - After Cleaning .xlsx

3. Peformed 

Consecutively we performed Univariate and Bivariate analysis - Bivariate Analysis.xlsx
