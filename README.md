# Customer-Segmenation

This project was taken upon as a Capstone Project for my internship at TheMathCompany. As a group of 4 we were tasked with understanding and contextualising the problem statement, perform EDA, finalise variables after VIF, test different models like regression, random forest, SVM, etc to determine key results. 

In this project the following were accomplished - 

1. Contextualized problem statement definition can be found in - Customer_Segmentation_VOX.pdf

2. Understood the dataset - Dataset Summary.xlsx

3. Generated data dictionary after cleaning the dataset - Data Dictionary - After Cleaning .xlsx

4. Peformed Factor Mapping and Hypothesis testing - Factor Mapping and Hypothesis.xlsx

5. Consecutively performed EDA including Univariate and Bivariate analysis - Bivariate Analysis.xlsx

6. Conducted feature extraction - Feature_extraction_bivariates.xlsx

7. Checked correlation between variables - Correlation Matrix.xlsx

8. Picked out highly correlated variables - Highly_corr_cols.xlsx

9. Checked viability of variables and selected the appropriate features  - VIF_Data.xlsx & VIF_Iterations.xlsx

10. Fit different models - Modelling Iterations.xlsx

11. The capstone project included presentations of different stages of the solution which were divided into three reviews : 

      - Review 1 - Capstone Project - NAJM - Final Deck.pptx
      - Review 2 - Capstone Project - NAJM - Final Deck.pdf
      - Review 3 - Capstone Project - NAJM - Final Deck.pptx
   
12. Wrote a paper and submitted to the universsity for my final year practicum (graded)
